    <p>About G20</p>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      The Group of Twenty (G20) is the premier forum for international economic cooperation. It plays an important role
      in shaping and strengthening global architecture and governance on all major international economic issues.
      India holds the Presidency of the G20 from 1 December 2022 to 30 November 2023.

    </p><br>
    <p>The G20 summit is a forum for the leaders of the world's 20 largest economies to discuss and coordinate policies
      to address global economic, financial and political issues. The G20 was established in 1999 and holds annual
      summits, rotating among member countries. The summit typically covers a wide range of topics including trade,
      climate change, development, and international security. The goal of the G20 is to promote international financial
      stability, sustainable economic growth, and poverty reduction. The G20 also works to promote cooperation and
      coordination among the world's major economies to address global challenges</p><br>
    <p>
      The G20 summit is attended by the heads of state or government of the member countries, as well as representatives
      of international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization
      (WTO). The summit is also attended by leaders of invited guest countries and international organizations. The G20
      leaders discuss and make decisions on a wide range of economic and political issues, and also adopt a communique
      outlining the main outcomes of the summit.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      The G20 also has several working groups and committees that meet regularly to discuss specific issues and make
      recommendations to the leaders at the summit. These working groups cover issues such as development, energy, and
      food security.

    </p><br>
    <p>
      The G20 has been criticized for its lack of enforcement mechanisms, and the slow progress on some issues. However,
      it remains one of the most important global forums for discussing and coordinating economic and financial
      policies.
    </p><br>
    <p>

      In addition to the annual summit, the G20 also holds several other meetings throughout the year, such as finance
      ministers and central bank governors meetings, Sherpa meetings, and meetings of the G20 engagement groups (which
      include representatives from the private sector, civil society, and labor organizations). These meetings provide
      opportunities for G20 leaders and officials to discuss and coordinate policies on an ongoing basis.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      Overall, the G20 is an important forum for leaders of the world's major economies to discuss and coordinate
      policies on a wide range of economic, financial and political issues. It has played a significant role in
      addressing global challenges and promoting sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction.
